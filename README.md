# README

This repository is a starting point for your class project. It contains
a Nodejs app that serves a static web page (showing a list of pets,
after pressing a button) and a single REST entry-point that is used to
fetch that list.

## What is this repository for?

Once you fork this repo, you can completely modify it at your own will
to write your project. You will find the instructions to deploy this
repo directly to your heroku account below.
